## Overview

The final project can be visited at https://naughty-ride-7e6995.netlify.app/".
Only HTML and CSS was used to develop this page. The build approach was to have the mobile first view and the work from there to have two different breakpoints. I considered to increase the font size due to the lack of content in the page, so it won't look with too much empty space around the page.
